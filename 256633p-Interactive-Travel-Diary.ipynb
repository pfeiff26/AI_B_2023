On calling for his bill on the morning of his departure [from Lyon] he was astounded to find the two little bedrooms charged twelve francs for the night. He said he would not pay it, but they were very impertinent and told him he should not be allowed to take his luggage till he paid. Thereupon he took the heavier articles himself (his principal luggage being at the station) and desired Mrs Gilchrist to take the cloaks and some smaller things, and so they walked out of the house. But they were immediately followed by two of the waiters who dogged them towards the station. They did not venture to touch Mr Gilchrist but one of them seized the cloaks in Mrs Gilchrist’s hands and when, at her husband’s desire she resisted & held them, he struck at her fingers to cause her to let them go. On this Mr Gilchrist shouted for the police but there were none at hand, so he threatened to knock the scoundrel down if he touched her again. (...).

        "# Andrew Macgeorge's Interactive Travel Diary\n",
        "\n",
        "Explore Southern Europe through the eyes of a 19th century Scotsman! In this notebook you will have the chance to engage with [Andrew Macgeorge](https://https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography,_1885-1900/Macgeorge,_Andrew)’s travel journal which details his continental tour from 1867-1868. Born in Glasgow in 1810 and passing away in Rew in 1891, Macgeorge was a writer, historian, and lawyer who had a deep passion for the arts. His travel diary with the reference code [GB 247 MS Gen 13](https://www.gla.ac.uk/collections/#/details?irn=250262&catType=C&referrer=/results&q=ms+gen+13) is stored as part of the [University of Glasgow's Special Collections](https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/archivespecialcollections/). The diary spans 30 pages of highly entertaining personal anecdotes that are occasionally complemented by funny sketches. While it is strongly recommended to explore the original artefact at the University, this notebook enhances your understanding of Macgeorges travels by taking you on an interactive journey from his rural estate in Argyll & Bute to Paris, Nice, and all the way to Rome using generative artifical intelligence (GenAI). As David Foster explains in his book [“Generative Deep Learning”](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/generative-deep-learning/9781098134174/), GenAI refers to a class of artificial intelligence systems designed to generate new content, such as text, images, or even music that is similar to, but not directly copied from, existing examples. These systems use machine learning techniques, to understand and mimic patterns within the data they are trained on, allowing them to create unique content. For example, if you wanted to create novel yet realistic cat pictures, you could present a generative model with a large dataset of cat images. From this \"training data\" the program learns the general characteristics of a cat's appearance (e.g. whiskers, tails, point ears). By combining these learned features it generates new never-seen-before cat images. GenAI is the underlying technology for popular Chatbots like [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt) or for language-to-image generation systems like [Dall-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2).\n",
        "\n",
        "**At the end of this notebook, you will find the new, *interactive* travel diary.** You are invited to browse through a selection of 19 different diary entries, each corresponding to a different location, which are displayed on a map of Europe. They contain transcribed excerpts from the original artefact alongside scans of his sketches and photographs. Where no original images exist, I used GenAI to create visual representations of the entries in the same drawing and photography styles. You can compare the historic images with current VR photography of the locations directly on the map using [Google Street View](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Street_View). You might also try and find out which images are generated by AI and which ones are authenitcally from the 19th Century. **Ask yourself, do the images evoke the same reaction in you, regardless of how they were generated?**\n",
        "\n",
        " But the adventure does not end with Macgeorge: Unleash your personal creativity and craft your own diary entries, expertly phrased in flawless Victorian English, complete with Macgeorge's distinct snarky tone. No need for a PhD in Historical Linguistics – collaborate seamlessly with generative AI to travel back in time.Through this you can learn about life in the 19th century and reflect on your own experiences travelling abroad. Ask yourself:\n",
        "1. **What universal similarities across time and place can you find?**\n",
        "2.  **What has changed in these places between Macgeorge's visit and today?**\n",
        "\n",
        "You can transform your own iconic real-life travel anecdotes into a Victorian diary entry or use your imagination to build on Macgeorges experiences and come up with further adventures the family might have made.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, the objectives of this notebook are not only to give you an insight into life at the time and draw comparisons to the present, but also to enhance your understanding of GenAI. Join me as I break down the fascinating technical process behind the creation of this interactive diary.\n",

        "Since the diary details a journey across multiple cities, I wanted to capture the spatial relationships between the entries on a map. I also wanted you to be able to access Google Street View to compare historical pictures to the present. [Scholars agree](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780429462030-4/participatory-maps-inka-salovaara/) that interactive maps are the most effective way to engage an audience with a topic that has a geographical dimension.

        "\n",
        "The task of writing travel diary entries in the style of Andrew Macgeorge is an incredibly complex task for a computer to perform. The AI model must possess a vast historical language corpus, a comprehensive understanding of historical and geographical context, as well as cultural intricacies. It requires an understanding of the semantic relationships between words, phrases, and ideas, as well as the ability to maintain a consistent narrative tone. The language model needs the ability to generate vivid descriptions, evoke emotions, and simulate the author's unique voice. The models used for these complex tasks are commonly referred to as [Large Language Models(LLM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model). LLMs are a type of neural network that can understand and generate language by learning the statistical relationships between sequences of data such as words or sentences. For example, a language model might predict the next word in a sentence based on the probability of each word given the context of the preceding words. Given the phrase \"The cat is,\" the model might assign a higher probability to words like \"purring\" compared to less likely options such as “talking” or “chirping”. Neural networks (such as LLMs) are one of the most advanced forms of machine learning models. They are inspired by the human brain, consisting of interconnected nodes organised into layers. During training, the model adjusts weights and biases to minimise the difference between predicted and actual outputs. To learn more about the role of weights and biases in neural networks watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk) or take a look at a [previous notebook](https://github.com/pfeiff26/AI_A_2023/blob/main/2023_Pfeiffer_AI_A/2566336p_Week_5-11_Chorales_AI_v2.ipynb) I have compiled. The most successful LLMs such as OpenAI’s [ChatGPT](https://www.thoughtspot.com/data-trends/ai/what-is-transformer-architecture-chatgpt) or most recently Google’s [Gemini](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-next-generation-model-february-2024/) use so-called Transformers. A Transformer is a type of neural network architecture used for understanding and processing sequences of data. It stands out because of its self-attention mechanism: Imagine reading a sentence. Rather than processing each word one after the other, the Transformer considers all words simultaneously and assigns different levels of importance to each word. This way, it learns which words often appear together and grasps the significant relationships within the data.

Therefore, the only way to create an AI model to perform the task was to build upon an existing application and fine-tune it to the language of Andrew Macgeorge.

        "# extract from travel diary transcript as style example\n",
        "language_example = \"1867A suggestion made by Dr [Simer/Suner?] backed by the recommendation of Dr Cowan made us resolve, on a very short notice and after very short consideration, to go to Nice for the winter. I had my misgivings. Talking about it to my friend Mr Angus Turner he said that he also ought to go to Nice or some other place in the South – but then, he added, it is not a one sided matter that is to be considered. Against the advantages of climate are to be set the disadvantages of the long journey – the troubles inseparably incident to travelling, and the utter abandonment of all home comforts. It is all too true. But we shall see. We left Glenarn on Monday the 21st of October, after making very special and careful provision for the comforts of Hinsé during our absence; and having put the house in Somerset Place in order for Mrs MacNair who is to occupy it during the winter, we started from Glasgow by the Caledonian Railway on the mor/ning of Tuesday the 29th. The first instalment of the miseries of travelling had then been got through – the weeks packing – the purchasing of boxes – the filling and emptying of them – the arranging & re-arranging – the discussions, the [s--?], the speculation, as to what must be taken & what might be left[pen and ink drawing of couple packing]ending by taking far more than was necessary. Those of the female persuasion had each a large box & a hand bag of considerable dimensions. I had a smaller box and a portmanteau, but both box and portmanteau had forced upon them a large amount of the overflowings of the ladies boxes. Besides this there was a large travelling bag destined to contain only “things to be used in a Hotel at night” but crammed with fifty et ceteras besides – also overflowings from the two large boxes aforesaid. Then there was a large parcel of cloaks and shawls – a bundle of umbrellas, and deal box containing half a dozen/bottles of port to keep us going till a larger supply which Mr Sandeman was to forward to Marseilles & to be sent thence to Nice, should arrive. At last we got off[pen and ink drawing of heavily loaded coach]At 10.45 we arrived at the Charing Cross Hotel (the train being late). It was a horrid chill wet day. We had as our companion in the carriage Miss Wingate – a niece of Sir George, whom we had met lately at Ben rhydding, on her way to a boarding school. Next morning (30th October) we started for Paris via Boulogne – a far superior route to that of Dover & Calais, & served by a far superior class of steamers. Last night we heard it blowing very hard, but although it was comparatively calm today the effects of the storm were visible in a considerable swell which/produced the usual pleasant consequences on our numerous fellow passengers. Mrs M. went down at once to the ladies cabin, and lay down on the floor – all the sofas being occupied, and escaped very well. Margaret remained with me on deck, & was not sick, and we enjoyed, from a comfortable seat next the funnel, the sights and sounds by which the passage was enlivened. There was a couple opposite to use – evidently newly married – who attracted a large share of our attention. Milady at the best was not good looking (which the bridegroom was) and what was at first a great paleness settled into a thorough greenness of complexion which must have been deeply interesting to her amiable companion. She lay back at last in his arms during the remainder of the passage while he contemplated her with a very rueful expression[pen and ink drawing of seasick passengers]but I cannot do justice to it. The steamer was the Albert Edwards a very fine large vessel with (as I learned from the steward) upwards of 200 basins for the relief of afflicted voyagers./Here is another group (they were all sketched on the spot from our seat at the funnel – a nurse with a very fashionable bonnet, very sick, and a nice little[pen and ink drawing of seasick passengers]boy in her charge who appeared to be not absolutely in extremis but dazed, and who occasionally looked round with wonder at the unwanted surroundings with which probably he for the first time found himself. They had a basin between them, & the little fellow held on to his side of it with a business like tenacity worthy of all admiration. A decent woman with an umbrella evidently feeling deeply the “mal de mer” was on the one side, and a dull Dutch looking character was on the other, with a basin at his feet & his hands in his pockets – his head bent low & apparently not knowing what to make of it. A little farther off was another couple also (as Margaret insisted) newly married, and the bride was in that state (drawing so largely on the creaking resources of the ship) that I wondered what her spouse was thinking when he contrasted her then position with that when all smiles and roses she/had just a little before appeared at the altar. It was raining – sometimes heavily, & as very few of the afflicted was able to hold up umbrellas their plight when they landed at Boulogne must have been anything but enviable. Just one more sketch before I leave this which has been by far the pleasantest part of our journey hitherto. Here is a “distinguished foreigner” wrapped in a sort of Turkish blanket who sat immovably in this one position all the time of the passage. The turban indicated[pen and ink drawing of seasick passengers]something eastern – but I could not tell. He looked fierce and angry as if the sea was taking an unwarrantable liberty with his dignity. There was no pretence to dignity on the part of the two unfortunates on either side of him.On reaching Boulogne another phase of the pleasures of travelling was experienced. The squeeze getting on shore, & the bother of our numerous ‘small/Packages’ – for altho’ our ‘grands baggages’ had been registered to Paris (they would not register it farther) we had quite enough of small articles to drive any one distracted whose nerves were short of iron – and of course, as the point of honour it fell to my lot to carry the most of them[pen and ink drawing of coming ashore]I had the carpet bag and the cloaks, and the box of wine – for they refused to register the latter at London, because it contained ‘taxable articles’ viz Mr Sandemans six bottles of port. At last we struggled through – myself in a state of mind not to be described – wishing myself at home, and deeply impressed with the philosophical wisdom of Mr Turners views. But I was unable to get the bag & box up the gangway and had to resign them to the care of a sailor who promised to follow with them but who did not. Having after infinite difficulty and torture – mental and bodily got Mrs. M. & Margarets/placed in one of the omnibuses which carry the passengers to the Railway I returned to my bag and box and having mounted the gangway with them and got to the door of the small wooden booth which does duty as a Custom house I proceeded to declare to one of the Douaniers in what I conceived to be unexceptionable French the contents of my deal box so that I might pay the sum of two shillings & sixpence to his Majesty the Emperor being the duty per gallon imported by the state on the import of ‘vins rouges’. But before I got three words uttered the scoundrel extended the palm of his hand towards me in an attitude of deprecation and casting up his eyes exclaimed in a long despair ‘Ah non! Non! Non! Je n’entends pas un mot d’Anglais!’ – ‘Mais Monsieur’ I remonstrated, ‘il n’est pas Anglais’ and when he deigned to listen I proceeded to make plain to him that the box contained wine but only for the use of madame and me during our ‘voyage’ – whereupon he desired me to pass on – me & my box with a gesture which seemed to ask me if I could suppose it possible that his master the Emperor could deign to accept of duty on so miserable an importation. By the time I got this matter just right all the omnibuses had left and I had to take a voiture to the station. Here I found my relatives entering the sale à manger and having first deposited our things in one of the first/class carriages I joined them & had some tough ‘ros bif’ and very bad wine and started for Paris at 3.40. At Amiens we stopped for 20 minutes where we got excellent coffee with bread & butter ad libitum at the moderate charge of one franc each. At 8.15 we arrived at Paris and by means of a small deneear to the guide (who always accompanies this train from London) and who spoke to one of the portiers of the Douane we got our registered baggage examined at once – or rather passed at once for I was not asked to open a single package. We drove first to the Hotel de Londres but the only rooms they had were too high up. We then crossed the street (the Rue Castiglione) to the Hotel de Famille No 6 – where Miss Black used to stay – a comfortable and well regulated Pension where we succeeded in getting rooms – small certainly but comfortable; and there we stayed till Monday the 4th of November. These are the ways of the house. The worst about them is that they do not keep early hours. Nothing in the shape of hot water or otherwise to be had before eight o’clock. But at that hour or any time after that you like they send to your room, or, if you prefer it, you may have the salle à manger tea or coffee with bread & butter. This is the first breakfast. Then at any time after that down to one o’clock you can have/dejuner à la fourchette – a mutton chop or beef steak – sometimes roast fowl with tea or coffee. The table d’hote is at six – excellent and at eight a cup of tea is served in the drawing room – a very handsome apartment when there is music and cards and chess or reading as may be preferred. The people - meaning the visitors – appeared to be of a superior class and seemed to be well pleased. We are charged 10 francs a day for rooms & living – everything included except lights and the table d’hote included very good wine – a bottle to every two persons. On Thursday we set off to the Exhibition early and having got a Bath chair for Mrs M. went through a great many of the Courts. Afterwards we went to the ‘Bible stand’ in the garden where so many millions of copies of portions of the Scriptures have since the opening of the Exposition been distributed to people of so many nationalities – each in his own language. I obtained a few copies in several languages as a memorial of this interesting & important enterprise. We also went into the Salle Evangiligne a small chapel, also, in the garden where we heard short services in/French & English alternately. These continue during the greater part of each day. The address in English which we heard & a prayer were by Mr Bradley of Clifton to whom I afterwards spoke and who gave me one of his little tracts. The picture galleries did not interest me. There was a more than usual preponderance of trash. It was refreshing to light upon Sir Edwin Landseer’s ‘Taming of the shrew’ (a lady reclining against her favourite horse) and a very superior picture by [Ma--] of a lady in a grey dress with a child. In seeking a place to lunch we, unwisely, avoided the English place and went to one of the French restaurants and had villainously bad, & very dear meal. Having sent the ladies home in a cab I took another tour of inspection of the Exhibition and got home comfortably in an omnibus all the way to the Rue Castiglione for the moderate charge of three sous.  At six we joined the table d’hote where fully sixty sat down to dinner and an excellent dinner it was – belying certainly in this instance the idea that at Pension you are worse served than at a hotel. The carte was as follows: 1. Soup 2. Stewed tongue 3. Roast fowl 4. Stewed celery 5. Roast beef with salad 6. Crème de vanille & sweet biscuits 7. dessert of grapes &c. In the evening I had/a walk with a gentleman staying in the hotel along the rue Rivoli & Palais Royal – always amusing at night when the shops are so brilliantly lighted.On Friday (1 Nov.) Margaret unwell & confined to bed by cold. Being All Saints Day Mrs M. and I went at eleven to the Church of St Rock & heard remarkably fine chanting and singing. After lunch we took a voiture and drove to Notre Dame – the restoration, or cleaning & re-carving rather, of which, is now complete. Here also we heard fine music and saw the Archbishop of Paris in robes blazing with gold and his mitre on his head sitting with his clergy within the altar. Home by the boulevard des Italiens – table d’hote at six and spent the rest of the evening in the drawing room.On Sunday (1 Nov [sic]) after first breakfast in our own rooms I walked to the Post Office but got no letters. I was glad however to meet our friend Mr Nelson from Edinburgh who is here with his wife. – Returning, read the newspapers – of which there is a good supply in the sitting room and then had déjuner à la fourchette. Mrs M. and Margaret went to a place near the Bois de Boulogne to call on Eliza Campbell/who is at school there and I betook myself again to the Exhibition where I spent about three hours. But it got tiresome at last. It was just a succession of arcades and shops and nowhere any fine general effect. In one department I saw several opals described as ‘the largest in the world’. The prices were affixed – the largest 175,000 francs and another 140,000. In another place among specimens of English printed books I saw a copy of the “Armorial Insignia of Glasgow” displayed. In the evening I had a game of chess with a lady & then we had a game of whist. They appeared to be a nice class of people who frequent this house.On Sunday morning (3) we went to the Scotch Chapel at l’Oratoire where it was announced that Dr Norman McLeod was to preach. The place was crowded but in his room his brother Donald – Minister of Linlithgow – officiated and gave us an admirable sermon. Dr. Norman himself appeared in the afternoon and delivered to a densely crowded audience (but the place is small) a very striking and interesting address on Missions. I went into the vestry before the service & had a few minutes conversation with him. He appeared grave & without his usual good humour and vivacity. He told me his fellow/traveller Dr Watson was laid up in his hotel with an attack of Pleurisy – but they were to start nevertheless next evening by the express train right through to Marseilles as they required to be on board their steamer next morning. Before going home I had short walk in the Tuileries gardens – the weather very fine. The ‘No-Sunday’ at Paris was not so striking as it used to be as many shops were shut – But plenty remained open for all sorts of customers and in the evening we had people – ladies as well as gentlemen – playing whist in the drawing room.On Monday morning (4) we started for Lyons by the 11 am express and at the station again endured the usual torture with [?] luggage &c. In the same carriage with us was an English gentleman, a Mr Gilchrist with his wife. He had travelled a great deal & for several years had been abroad during the winter for his health. He gave us a great deal of information as to hotels at Hyères, Cannes & Nice – which we afterwards/found to be very useful  -also as to the customs of Nice and the ways and doings of mosquitos in particular – a portion of the inhabitants of whose residence I had been in ignorance but with whom to our cost we were destined to form relation of very intimate acquaintanceship. Before leaving the Paris station we were gratified by the sight of an interesting individual, accompanied by some ladies – whose physique was after this fashion. The moustache which is not in the slightest degree exaggerated was of a sandy grey[pen and ink sketch of moustached man]At the Dijon station where we dined we had the best table d’hote I have yet seen on the railways. The charge was 3.f. 50c. and we had soup, roast beef with fried potatoes, stewed hare & onions with toast, cold fish (Brockes?) brussels sprouts with sauce, roast fowl and salad, stewed pears with rice and a/liberal dessert of beautiful grapes, pears sweet biscuits &c. We arrived at Lyons about 10.30 and walked to the Hotel d’Angleterre ed des Deux Mondes, Place Napoleon, close to the station on the left hand as you go out. We had been recommended by Mr Gilchrist to try it – not that he had ever been in it himself but because it looked like a nice home and was so near the station. We were certainly put into excellent rooms of which the waiter who showed us said the price was 5f. 50c. for the two and we were sufficiently well satisfied with what we got to eat. But our views were changed by what transpired afterwards. Mr & Mrs Gilchrist who had passed the night at Dijon arrived at the Hotel on the second night of our staying there, and I told the people of the hotel they were coming & to try to give them good rooms. – But they got only one small bed room and another room still less opening from it, which they took only to give them air, as the two small beds were in the first room. They were not at all equal to ours, and ought to have/been charged less. We left Mr Gilchrist there but he afterwards told me at Nice what happened to them. On calling for his bill on the morning of his departure he was astounded to find the two little bedrooms charged twelve francs for the night. He remonstrated but they persisted in the charge. He said he would not pay it, but they were very impertinent and told him he should not be allowed to take his luggage till he paid. Thereupon he took the heavier articles himself (his principal luggage being at the station) and desired Mrs Gilchrist to take the cloaks and some smaller things, and so they walked out of the house. But they were immediately followed by two of the waiters who dogged them towards the station. They did not venture to touch Mr Gilchrist but one of them seized the cloaks in Mrs Gilchrist’s hands and when, at her husband’s desire she resisted & held them, he struck at her fingers to cause her to let them go. On this Mr Gilchrist shouted for the police but there were none at hand, so he threatened to knock the scoundrel down if he touched her again and insisted on his going to the station before the principal/officer of police there. The waiters did so and the officer ordered them immediately to bring their master who after some delay appeared. The officer told Mr Gilchrist that he could not interfere on the question of the bill as that was a matter for the Juge de Paix but he said he would take cognisance of the assault on Mrs Gilchrist. It ended in the master of the hotel receiving a severe rating with an intimation that his name, in connection with the affair, would be placed on the police books, and as to the bill the villain was fair to accept the six francs for the rooms which Mr Gilchrist had at first offered. I note these particulars that I may recollect them for the information of future travellers whom I may hear of going to Lyons so that they may avoid a house which no respectable traveller ought ever in any circumstances to enter. They tried to do us also, for there were several overcharges in the bill including a charge for the/\""

The images were created using [DALL-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2), an AI system that can generate images from scratch or modify existing images based on a description in natural language. It was trained using millions of image and caption pairs so that it associates words with certain groups of pixels in images that correspond to specific objects, colours, textures or other visual features.\n",

        "DALL-E 2 is based on a similar Transformer architecture as the one mentioned above in the “Text Generation AI” section, However, once the meaning of the input prompt’s words is extracted, the structured semantic representation is passed on to something called a [Variational Autoencoder (VAE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DALL-E).\n",
        "\n",
        "In a process called **_latent space exploration_**, the VAE uses this encoded representation to find associated visualisations of the objects and concepts mentioned in the input prompt. The latent space is a highly complex concept where the visual features of an object are represented by structured attributes. Imagine you have a lot of pictures of cats, each with different features like colour, size, and pose. Now, think of all these features as being part of a hidden or \"latent\" space. This latent space doesn't directly represent the pictures themselves but captures the underlying characteristics or factors that make each cat picture unique. So, the latent space is like an abstract space where you can represent and explore the essential features or factors that define something, without directly looking at the actual examples.\n",

These features, along with the original textual encoding, are then used by the transformer to decode and reconstruct the final image. The collaborative effort between transformers and VAEs ensures that the generated images not only align with the given textual descriptions but also exhibit richness and diversity, allowing for a more expressive and nuanced form of image generation.

A computer is given the task of generating a creative piece, in this case a short travel diary entry. The goal is to see if the AI can not only generate content but do so in a way that aligns with pre-defined human-defined criteria. If the AI has generated content that satisfies a human judge, it will score a point and be presented with a new, more difficult task.\n",
